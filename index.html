                    <b> Brief:</b>
                    <p> Group project to solve a real world problem using the full stack to showcase the skills we have learned on the Bootcamp.
                    </p>
                    <p> This application addresses the issue many parents face when trying to teach their children about responsibilty, accountabilty
                        and rewards are earned through hard work and setting goals.  The application is essentially a tool a parent can use to set up a 
                        list of tasks or chores for the child and allocates a value to the chore.  The parent also sets up the child's user access and can 
                        set a goal or total reward value.

                        When the child completes the chore they are able to log in and mark the task as done/finished which is when they earn their reward.
                        The child can track the rewards they earn to the goal that has been set up and once they reach the target reward/goal the parents 
                        are then able to give the child the treat they earned.  The "rewards" are selected by the parents and child, so for example an older 
                        child or teenager may elect to earn money while a younger child may want to earn stars/badges etc.

                    <b> Brief:</b>
                    <p> Using a 3rd party API to collect data, in this case data about the weather for a location you "Search".
                        Save the Searched location for future searches and display the weather details for the current day and also display a 
                        five day weather forecast, highlighting the severity of the UV Index
                    </p>
                    <p> Saved locations are stored in local storage but only the last ten searches are presented back for another Search.  
                        Built a button to toggle the display of the forecasted weather and ensured that any city that was entered for Searching was not saved to
                        the top ten Searches again.  The solution makes use of the open-weather-api to source its data.
